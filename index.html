 <p> In just a few hours, the "Concord" Air Jordan 11 will make its official return to retail. Arguably the single most popular shoe from the entire Air Jordan signature line, the "Concords" were Michael Jordan's primary weapon of choice during the Chicago Bulls' historic 1995-1996 season. Teamed up with Hall of Famers Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, as well as key role players like Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc and Steve Kerr, MJ and the Bulls won an NBA record 72 regular season games en route to the franchise's fourth NBA Championship. Jordan also swept the All-Star, League and Finals MVP Awards, was named First Team All NBA and All Defense and won his eighth of ten overall scoring titles.

In anticipation of the big release, Sole Collector takes a trip down memory lane. Throughout the following pages of this post are more than 40 photos of Michael Jordan himself wearing the "Concords." Note that some of the pictures of the Chicago Bulls playing against the Orlando Magic are from the 1995 Eastern Conference Finals, where Michael actually debuted the Air Jordan XI prior to the 1995-1996 season.

Enjoy and good luck getting your "Concords!"</p>
